Welcome to my first Three.js project featuring the sleek Porsche Mission R! 🏎️ In this immersive experience, you'll have the opportunity to interact with this stunning model in a variety of ways.
HAVE FUN!

## Project Structure 🏗️

-   📚 **Three.js Library**: The project is built using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
-   🚗 **Model**: Featuring the Porsche Mission R, a cutting-edge electric race car, meticulously crafted for a lifelike experience.

-   💢 **Interactive Features**:
    -   💡 **Lights**: Toggle the car's lights on and off, adding to the realism of the scene.
    -   🔈 **Sound**: Immerse yourself in the experience by toggling engine sounds on and off.
    -   👀 **POV View**: Get a driver's perspective by exploring the point-of-view camera feature.

## Purpose 🎯

My aim with this project is to delve into the world of Three.js while simultaneously creating an engaging experience for users. By allowing interaction with a detailed model like the Porsche Mission R, I hope to spark curiosity and interest in both Three.js and the world of 3D web development.

So buckle up, toggle those lights, rev the (⚡) engine, and enjoy the ride! 🌟
